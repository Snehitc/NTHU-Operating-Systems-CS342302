# Task
Similar to PPC 2, but here we use 3 buffers instead of 1 and a Semaphore for controlling shared resources.<br/>

> ### PPC 2
> Same as PPC 1, with the difference that instead of using ThreadYield, we use Timer0Handler.<br/>
> ### PPC 1
> - Producer: Generate one character at a time from 'A' to 'Z' and start again from 'A'
> - Consumer: Write the character to the serial Tx port (which can be seen at the UART Rx port)

# Advice
Read and understand the report [beginners friendly]; it has all the necessary details required to complete this task and a nice description about how the code is executing.
