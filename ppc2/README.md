# Task
Same as PPC 1, with the difference that instead of using ThreadYield, we use Timer0Handler.<br/>
> ### PPC 1
> - Producer: Generate one character at a time from 'A' to 'Z' and start again from 'A'
> - Consumer: Write the character to the serial Tx port (which can be seen at the UART Rx port)
